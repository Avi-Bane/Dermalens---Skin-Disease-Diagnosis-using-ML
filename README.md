# Dermalens---Skin-Disease-Diagnosis-using-ML
CNN model for Skin diesease images 


Skin diseases are among the most common health issues worldwide, affecting millions of people across different age groups and regions. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management. However, traditional diagnostic methods often rely on the expertise of dermatologists, which may not always be accessible, especially in remote areas.​

​
This project leverages the power of Machine Learning (ML) to revolutionize the diagnosis of skin diseases. By utilizing advanced algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network, the system can analyze dermatoscopic images to identify and classify various skin conditions with high accuracy. The integration of ML not only enhances diagnostic efficiency but also makes healthcare more accessible and affordable.

About the Dataset:-
Context
The data consists of images of 23 types of skin diseases taken from http://www.dermnet.com/dermatology-pictures-skin-disease-pictures. The total number of images are around 19,500, out of which approximately 15,500 have been split in the training set and the remaining in the test set.

Content
The images are in JPEG format, consisting of 3 channels, i.e. RGB. The resolutions vary from image to image, and from category to category, but overall these are not extremely high resolution imagery.

The categories include acne, melanoma, Eczema, Seborrheic Keratoses, Tinea Ringworm, Bullous disease, Poison Ivy, Psoriasis, Vascular Tumors, etc.

Acknowledgements
The images are taken from the public portal Dermnet (http://www.dermnet.com/) which is the largest dermatology source online built for the purpose of providing online medical education.
